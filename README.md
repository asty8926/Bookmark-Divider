# Bookmark-Divider Project

Are you tired of having so many bookmarks in your bookmarks bar that you can't separate in any way?

Sure you can remove the name of a bookmark to only keep its icon and gain space, but what if you could do that **AND** have custom dividers between them?

This is precisely what this project is about.

## Features

- 3 different dividers shapes to chose from (horizontal bar, vertical bar, and circle)
- 3 different colors per divider (gray, white, and light blue)
- 10 different pages to bookmark per divider, for a total of 30 pages per divider per color, which means `30 * 3 = 90` total dividers to use as bookmarks!
- Clean and modern UI, without clutter
- Completely Free to use
