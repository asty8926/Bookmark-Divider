# Bookmark-Divider Project

Are you tired of having so many bookmarks in your bookmarks bar that you can't visually separate in any way?

Sure you can remove the name of a bookmark to only keep its icon and gain space, but what if you could do that **AND** have custom dividers between them?

This is precisely what this project is about.

If you want to share the website around you, I tried my best to include the relevant meta tags in HTML so the link embeds well on social media like Twitter and Discord, including a title, a title URL, a thumbnail and a brief description of what the project is about. 

## Features

- 3 different dividers shapes to choose from (horizontal bar, vertical bar, and circle)
- 3 different colors per divider (gray, white, and light blue)
- 10 different pages to bookmark per divider, for a total of 30 pages per divider per color, which means `30 * 3 = 90` total dividers to use as bookmarks!
- Clean and modern UI, without clutter
- Completely Free to use

## How does it work and how do I use it?

The project makes use of what's called a "favicon", which is the logo of a website that is displayed both when you have it open in a tab, or when you bookmark it.
A favicon can be different for every page even on the same website, and this is precisely what I am doing.

### Guide

`1.` Go to the [website](https://asty8926.github.io/Bookmark-Divider/)

`2.` Pick the divider of your choice

`3.` Bookmark the page (*easy with `Cmd/Ctrl + D`*) to your bookmarks bar, and remove the bookmark name

`4.` Navigate through the 9 other pages for that divider and bookmark as many as you need!

## Bonus - Behind The Scenes | Planning out the project

Before starting to even type a single character of code, I brainstormed the desired User Flow in the form of a Chart/Mind Map on [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/), and then made a visual prototype/UI using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

**User Flow Chart:**

Here are the **Chart Legends**, to know how to read the above and what each shape and color corresponds to:
